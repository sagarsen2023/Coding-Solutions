# Python all exercises solution
## All the coding problems are uploaded in folder wise.

## Solution of conceptual qiestions:
a. **Explain the difference between print() and input() statement in Python.**

    Ans. We can just print statements in the console by using the print statement. But in case of input(), we can print statement with taking the user input, also we can check that if the input() statement compiled successfully or not. It helps us to do effective lines of code

b. **What are the different data types available in python? Provide examples.**

   Ans. Here is the solution
```python
   age = 25
   pi = 3.14
   name = "John Doe"
   is_raining = True
   is_sunny = False
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
   coordinates = (10, 20)
   student = {"name": "John", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}
   unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   result = None
   complex_number = 2 + 3j

   data_types = [age, pi, name, is_raining, is_sunny, fruits, coordinates, student, unique_numbers, result, complex_number]

   for data in data_types:
       print(f"{data} - {type(data)}")
```

c. **Describe the implementation of break and continue in Python.**

    Ans. **break**: We may break the loop before it loops over all of the objects by using the break statement.
         **continue**: We may use the continue statement to end the current iteration of the loop and begin the next.
        
d. Explain the concept of indexing in strings, lists, and tuples.

    Ans. Visit my notes: 
         Topic: Tuple lists and dictionary from page no 17 to 21. 
    
e. What is the purpose of a function in Python? Provide an example.
    
    
f. What is exception handling in Python? How is it useful?
    
    
g. Describe the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming.
  
    
h. Explain the concept of polymorphism with an example.
    
    
i. What is the purpose of the try-except block in Python? Provide an example.
    
    
j. Describe the concept of encapsulation in object-oriented programming.
